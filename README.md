# ☁️ NextCloud Service

This repository hosts the database files used by the **NextCloud Service** for **Metro OS**.  
These databases power various online features and services, such as **Shop**, and are designed to be fetched directly by Metro OS during runtime.

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> **NextCloud Service** is *not* the same as **NextCloud (the self-hosted cloud software)**.  
> - **NextCloud Service** → runs **Online**, hosted here  
> - **NextCloud** → runs **Locally** on your device

## 📁 About the Database Files
- All `.db` files are actually Zip archives
- You’re welcome to view the files, but this repo is **Not open for contributions**.  
  They exist solely so Metro OS can download them reliably.
- The `.sf` files are WAV files and the `.as` files are SVG assets
