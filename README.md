# ☁️ NextCloud Service

This repository hosts the database files used by the **NextCloud Service** for **Metro OS**.  
These databases power various online features and services, such as **Shop**, and are designed to be fetched directly by Metro OS during runtime.

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> **NextCloud Service** is *not* the same as **NextCloud (the self-hosted cloud software)**.  
> - **NextCloud Service** → runs **Online**, hosted here  
> - **NextCloud** → runs **Locally** on your device

## 📁 About the Database Files
- The `.db` files are Zip archives (A couple of them aren't and they are just text files)
- The `.sf` files are WAV files
- The `.as` files are SVG assets
- The `.cer` files are TXT files
- The `.sb3` files are Scratch Project files
- You’re welcome to view the files, but this repo is **Not open for contributions**. (This solely exists so Metro OS can download them reliably.)
